# Friend_Lists
Alexa is going to create a notebook including the profile of all her friends. For each of her friends, she would like to keep first-name, last-name, cell number, and birthdate (month and day). At the  beginning, she doesn’t know how many spaces she should reserve for recording her friends, so she  gradually inputs her friends’ information into it. 


-> This code is an introductory application of JAVA. In this, we are creating methods to add, modify and delete the contact profile of the user. The sorting method is      used too in this project to sort the profiles. 
-> A data structures are used for inserting, deleting, editing, and sorting of the profiles to make code efficient.
-> An introductory use of GUI is used in this project.
