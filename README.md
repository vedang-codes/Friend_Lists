Alexa is going to create a notebook including the profile of all her friends. For each of her friends, she would like to keep first-name, last-name, cell number, and birthdate (month and day). At the  beginning, she doesn’t know how many spaces she should reserve for recording her friends, so she  gradually inputs her friends’ information into it.
